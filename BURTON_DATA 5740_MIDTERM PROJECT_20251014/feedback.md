1. **Identify & Clarify the Problem (10/10 pts)**
   1. Great work articulating the problem

5. **Choose Modeling Approach (20/20 pts)**
6. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Assumptions (20/20 pts)**

7. **Fit the Model (20/20 pts)**
8. **Diagnostics (20/20 pts)**
9. **Address Deficiencies (20/20 pts)**
