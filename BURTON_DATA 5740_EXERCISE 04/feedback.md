Overall good work. On style, please include markdown cells or comments along the way that make it easy to follow where you're at with the code relative to the assignment. Also, consider using dataframe names other than `df1`. It's nice to use a variable name that tells you something about the underlying data. (-1)

When doing operations like "replace missing values with means" it's best to do that selectively, only on those columns that actually have missing values rather than applying fillna() to all columns.

Great work overall, though.
