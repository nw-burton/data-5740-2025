No, I am familiar with all parts of this code, but the thinking in the AI code is more complex and gives a more simplistic result.\n\nc. The major difference in my result and the AI result is the simplicity of the code and the order in which we took our steps. These were my key steps:\n    1. Determine the min, max, and bin width\n    2. create the boundaries\n    3. create a list of 2-value lists that contained the upper and lower bounds for each bucket\n    4. loop through the buckets and the values, adding 1 to the count if the value falls in the bucket\n    5. create a tuple of the upper and lower bounds and the count\n    6. append that tuple to the empty results list\n\nThe steps followed by the AI result were:\n    1. determine the min, max, and bin width\n    2. perform a loop 10 times (once to create each bucket)\n    3. calculate the lower bound, the upper bound, and then loop through the values and count 1 for each value between the bounds\n    4. append the resulting values for each loop as a tuple to the results list\n\nWhile accomplishing the same results, the AI version did this in fewer steps and lines of code, combining some of my steps into one step."

I can grasp the steps I need to take to get from problem to result, but I often have a more step-wise approach to getting there, as seen in my response to this problem. I think utilizing AI will reveal to me ways to combine steps or alter syntax to get the same result in fewer lines of code, making for more efficient coding."
