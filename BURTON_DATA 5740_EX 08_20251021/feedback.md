# Final Score 19/20

Doing PCA with so many variables was a good idea, but also a challenge to interpret!  You did a great job interpreting teh PCs and understanding what they represented in the real world. The only one that could have used some thinking was PC4.

Generally I think this was great, but you should have excluded `next12mo_spend` from the PCA considering it was the outcome we were trying to predict in the original setup.
